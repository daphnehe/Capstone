    "## Introduction\n",
    "##### In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) has become adept at producing text that closely mimics human writing, the ability to accurately differentiate between content created by humans and that generated by machines is more crucial than ever. Our project centers on developing and comparing various machine learning models to effectively make this distinction, which is a fundamental step in addressing the broader challenge of fake news detection.\n"

The testing set, which the models have not seen during training, is used to assess how well the models generalize to new, unseen data. This split ensures that our performance metrics reflect the model's capability to perform in real-world scenarios, not just on the data it has learned.\n",
